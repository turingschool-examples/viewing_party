# DTR: Define the Relationship
### Viewing Party Project

---

Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
 - Basic understanding of the new tools introduced in this project, ie: RuboCop, TravisCI, etc.
 - Understand the fundamentals of consuming APIs
 - Complete one or more extension story that expands our knowledge base outside of the curriculum.
 - Further our understanding of Github project board features (reviews, approval process, etc.)
 - Improve PR documentation

What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
 - Lito: My preferred approach is discuss project execution strategy, work independently, and then meet again to review the work. Pair programming is great for debugging.
 - Taija: More emphasis on paired programming. It can be easier to avoid unproductive struggle while working together.

How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
 - Lito: I think it’s best to set daily meet times to review the project and determine the next steps
 - Taija: Appreciate proactive feedback earlier than later.

How would you describe your work style?
 - Lito: I think setting expectations early and often is the key to successful collaborative efforts. Generally I prefer to work alone, though it’s better to ask for help early rather than bang your head against a wall when you’re stuck.
 - Taija: Regular breaks are very important. Time-boxing a work schedule is also a priority.

What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
 - Lito: I really enjoy learning and enjoy trying to make sense of complicated structures.
 - Taija: Organizational structure, maintaining a coherent stylistic structure throughout the project. Quick to reach out for help.

What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
 - Lito: Regular effective check-in meetings have helped clarify expectations and have kept team members aligned toward project goals. Communicating github workflow helps.
 - Taija: Making sure everybody is aware of their expectations, along with communicating about milestones achieved/upcoming PRs, etc, has been effective in the past. I have been made aware that I could be more communicative about time constraints.

How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
 - Review the project documentation, establish a milestone schedule, and see if it makes more sense to divide and conquer or to work together.

How will we overcome obstacles?
 - Lito: Bring up problems as they arise, not when it’s too late. Assume positive intent.
 - Taija: Be proactive about paired programming, utilize our resources (colleagues, mentors, etc) efficiently, maintain intentional and open communication.

What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
 - Lito: clear expectations on work and time schedule.
 - Taija: I appreciate knowing what is expected of me from my partner (both work wise and time wise), and I need regular breaks.

What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
 - Lito: Generally, I try to reserve 5-6pm for personal time. I am usually in front of the computer by 7am. Weekends are available - preference to have one day off.
 - Taija: No commitments before class. No work during lunch. Try to stop computer work by 8pm.

What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
 - Lito: I try to see where the other person is coming from before making assumptions.
 - Taija: “I” vs “You” feedback. Make it actionable.

What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
 - Lito: Solid test writing skills. Enjoy AR queries. Needs improvement in deployment, high level design, and github.
 - Taija: I feel pretty good about my debugging skills, except when it comes to Heroku. I would like to improve my Heroku skills, and my AR skills.  I would like to feel more comfortable making structural decisions, which could be related to feeling more confident about Rails applications as a whole.

What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
 - Github project board. Use issues as documentation for what you did.

How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
 - Lito: look at the code on a zoom call to see what the issues are. If we can’t figure it out together, then other team members can look at it independently to see if any light bulbs go off.
 - Taija: 1. google 2. pair programming with partner 3. ask for assistance from cohort 4. ask a mentor 5. reach out to contacts (family) 6. pair programming with instructor

How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
 - Lito: If we met the expectations, learned a lot in the process, and if everybody stayed on the same page.
 - Taija: If I can explain what happened and learned something that I’ll be able to implement in a future project

How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
 - Lito: it’s good to remember that even creating a successful test is by no means trivial!
 - Taija: Celebrate little wins.

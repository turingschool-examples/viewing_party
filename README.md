# Viewing Party

This is the base repo for the [viewing party project](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/viewing_party) used for Turing's Backend Module 3.

### About this Application

Viewing Party is an application that emulates the movie going experience by connecting you with friends that wish to watch the same film. It intuitively displays information for a given film such as; its popularity, the first ten cast members, and reviews for the given film.  Create your own party today, or just get invited to one of your friend's parties!

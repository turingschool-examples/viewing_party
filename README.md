## Viewing Party

Viewing Party in an application in which a user can access information about motion pictures from the database of TheMovieDB.org. By way of consuming various free API endpoints available on the TheMovieDB.org, Viewing Party can search for and render specific film information to users. Registered users can find other registered users and add them as friends. Registered users also have the ability to schedule and create a viewing party for any movie found on the database, and any friends of that user can be invited to the viewing party.

Viewing Party is live and running @ https://guarded-refuge-05465.herokuapp.com

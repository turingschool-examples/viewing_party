        you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nThe
        101 Dalmatians franchise is one of those Disney properties that is always
        broadcasted across all main television networks during holidays in my country,
        usually during Christmas. The live-action films of 1996 and 2000 are stored
        somewhere in my memory, even though I never really sat down and watched the
        movies all by myself. Cruella might just be another live-action film from
        the Mickey Mouse studio, but it''s far from being yet another remake, much
        on the contrary. Just like the vast majority of the company''s villains, Cruella
        de Vil (portrayed by Glenn Close in the previous installments) was even worse
        than the generic antagonist with cliche motivations that eventually every
        studio used and reused to exhaustion.\r\n\r\nBesides Cruella''s greedy necessities,
        purely evil personality, and extreme vanity, this wicked character was driven
        by something completely unthinkable: skinning short-haired puppies to have
        more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur. Anyone with a
        conscience knows that Disney would never bring this character back to the
        big screen in 2021 without making some changes, especially regarding this
        motivation in particular. How would a movie with a dog-killing protagonist
        at its front and center be remotely successful? Obviously, this hardcore motif
        no longer belongs to Emma Stone''s Cruella''s defining character traits, which
        might be a no-no for those viewers who are more protective of the original
        material, as if times and culture didn''t change from decade to decade.\r\n\r\nSince
        the start of Disney''s live-action remakes campaign, audiences have been divided
        about how to feel and what to expect from these films. Some wish for a copy-paste
        version of the same story, while others desire a completely different take
        on the well-known narrative. However, the best experience - and the primary
        goal of these movies - is a mix of both: a version that keeps the essence
        and the message of the original while bringing something new and different
        to the table to justify its existence. Cruella isn''t a remake but an origin(al)
        story based on a classic villain... And it''s undoubtedly one of the best
        films I''ve seen this year until this day! I didn''t expect to write an extensive
        review, but with so much to address, I know my thoughts will take a while
        to transcribe to this article.\r\n\r\nLet me start with some easy elements
        that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into \"deep analysis
        mode\". The costume design is indisputably the technical standout. The colorfully
        stunning dresses steal the show visually, but it''s how it differentiates
        Estella and Cruella that Jenny Beavan shines in her job. Just from what Stone
        wears, the viewers can easily decipher what character she''s playing. The
        differences between the glamorous, rich people that the Baroness surrounds
        herself with and the dirty, poor friends Estella meets at the beginning of
        the movie - Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) - is also accentuated
        through their wardrobes.\r\n\r\nThe extravagant parties are packed with Oscar-worthy
        costumes, but also with beautiful makeup & hair (Nadia Stacey) and absolutely
        ravishing production design (Fiona Crombie). Nicholas Britell''s score carries
        little references to the music of the other installments, as does the film
        itself. Craig Gillespie doesn''t hide the Easter Eggs spread throughout the
        runtime, of which some will definitely please the most avid fans. Technically,
        it''s as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio, but not everything
        is as impressive as the aspects above. In a movie where even the black-and-white
        hair and clothes of Cruella pop off the screen, the CGI backgrounds and animals
        are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyper-realistic remake
        of The Lion King.\r\n\r\nCGI dogs are employed during most of the runtime,
        which is not only understandable but also commendable. Animal violence in
        filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago. However,
        the VFX don''t look good enough, causing the dogs - mainly the Dalmatians
        - to be an unintended distraction. In addition to this, a specific outdoor
        location that''s quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully
        dark, fake background that just feels way too off. Finally, the ending boasts
        a ridiculous sequence made with terrible CGI that will definitely leave the
        more \"logic-driven\" viewers stunned with disappointment. I consider this
        a nitpick, especially since it''s not a film without silliness.\r\n\r\nIn
        fact, Cruella''s success partially rests on Gillespie''s tone balance. Jasper
        and Horace become the comic-relief characters, starring in the absurd action
        sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from.
        Now, some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their
        irrational fun. However, Dana Fox and Tony McNamara''s screenplay carries
        undeniable similarities to The Devil Wears Prada and the most recent Joker.
        Estella''s life story is far from being a happy tale, and Cruella''s rise
        even less. Overall, the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic,
        depressing, traumatic storyline is mostly well-handled, but there are a few
        moments where Gillespie lets it too loose, especially in the over-Disney-ish
        last fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nSo, let''s address the two protagonists: Estella
        and Cruella. The comparisons with Joaquin Phoenix''s take on Arthur Fleck
        / Joker are impossible to unsee. From the upbringing filled with bullying
        and family tragedy to the final transformation, Emma Stone''s character follows
        a similar arc, but with clear differences concerning the solution for her
        problems. Estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the self-centered,
        self-indulgent Baroness, which takes her down a learning path of how to be
        successful in the business. The Baroness'' despicable treatment of Estella
        brings the ruthless Cruella gradually back to life, eventually stealing the
        spotlight from the lovely little Estella who just wanted to do what she loved
        for a living... without having to carry on extreme measures.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected,
        clever twist pretty much completes the protagonist''s transformation, which
        genuinely caught me by surprise. I admit that I didn''t have high hopes for
        this origin story. Nevertheless, the well-written screenplay deeply explores
        a previously hollow villain, offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible
        motivations. While it''s true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics
        to the infamous Baroness, Cruella never truly becomes 100% that person. Honestly,
        I wouldn''t mind seeing a sequel, but I don''t think there''s room for another
        film that wouldn''t hurt the one we just got. So, there''s just one more aspect
        to delve into: the cast''s performances.\r\n\r\nJoel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser
        are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves. Both share a compelling
        connection to Estella, one that I believe deserved a better conclusion. They
        become a family, living and stealing throughout their lives, but when Estella
        starts giving Cruella some screentime, a few issues arise within the trio.
        These problems are indeed approached and solved, but in a less dramatic manner
        than I hoped for. Fry is excellent as the more competent, rational Jasper,
        but Hauser never stops being extremely funny. The before-mentioned balance
        is rarely affected by the characters'' comedic banter, which is something
        the actors also deserve credit for.\r\n\r\nEmma Thompson delivers one of my
        favorite performances of her recent filmography, interpreting the Baroness
        von Hellman. How can you make an extremely over-the-top character feel cartoonish
        yet strangely real? Someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype
        but still resembles dozens of people from the real world? Thompson takes her
        role, and the only reason why she doesn''t steal the spotlight from everyone
        else is because the other Emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a
        classic villain. With obvious references to Miranda Priestly from The Devil
        Wears Prada, Thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene, making
        every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
        Emma Stone manages to stay a level above everyone else. I firmly believe that
        she''s one of the best actresses of her generation. Carrying one of the most
        expressive faces in Hollywood, Stone was born to play a protagonist with two
        personalities. Without looking at the screen, any viewer will be able to know
        if she''s talking as Estella or Cruella. Not only she changes the tone of
        her voice depending on the character, but the mannerisms alter as well. It
        would be a massive surprise if such an early Disney performance got an Oscar
        nomination, so her chances are obviously thin. However, if there was an award
        for Best Monologue, Stone would be a strong contender.\r\n\r\nI don''t recall
        how many minutes it really is, but I can''t forget that long, uncut take with
        Stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out
        of an emotionally impactful monologue. Switching between Estella and Cruella
        in the span of milliseconds, her micro-expressions elevate a heartfelt, character-defining
        speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema. Stone gives not one
        but two impressive, attention-grabbing performances that will satisfy most
        viewers looking for a Cruella they can understand and even root for.\r\n\r\nCruella
        is not only one of 2021''s biggest surprises, but it''s also one of the best
        movies of the year so far. Despite the occasional lack of balance between
        the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative, Craig Gillespie offers an incredibly
        captivating origin(al) story about one of Disney''s classic villains. Dana
        Fox and Tony McNamara''s remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the Estella-Cruella
        transformation, giving her non-dog-killing, emotionally compelling motivations,
        a traumatic, depressing past, and an unexpected twist that will probably catch
        most viewers off-guard. With one of her best performances ever, Emma Stone
        delivers an award-worthy display, interpreting two personalities in impressive
        fashion, stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations.
        Technically, the distracting CGI in animals and some noticeable green-screen
        don''t overcome the predictably Oscar-winning, stunning costume design, as
        well as the gorgeous makeup & hair, wonderful production design, and sweet
        score packed with excellent song choices. A character study that makes this
        one of Disney''s best live-action films in the last couple of decades.\r\n\r\nRating:

        is one of the best villain origin stories. I had so much fun watching. Both
        Emmas are a joy to watch, they performed their characters very well. Emma
        is best as **Estella and Cruella** both.\r\n\r\nThe **world-building** and
        character development are too good. The background story of Cruella is brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe
        soundtrack is excellent and the costume designs deserve Oscar. Such beautiful
        costumes I get to see in this movie. The cinematography and direction are
        the best.\r\n\r\nCruella''s character is quite similar to Joker and Harley
        Quinn but still, Cruella is much different from both the anti villains.\r\n\r\nShe
        is dark and became burned by her career and looking for revenge as well as
        popularity just like the joker. While she loves unique costumes, makeup, a
        hairstyle like Harley Quin.\r\n\r\nShe is cynical too like Harley and self-interested
        but then Harley is a good-hearted person who just made bad decisions while
        Cruella is sociopathic and a bit cruel as well.\r\n\r\nIt''s a fun, surprising,
        and engaging movie.
